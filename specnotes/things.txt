GETTING A THING
        commander fires commandGet which picks the topmost thing at cell (or pops a UI with callback actor.tryGetThing(selection))

        actor.tryGetThing(thing)
                if (!thing.tryGetBy(this)) return;
                thing.moveTo(this)
                scroll.print(thing.getMsg(this))

Thing   
        .location()
                Container i'm in
        -moveTo(UContainer)
                Public method to move me.  Call removeThing on location, then addThing on destination container.
        .onMove(UContainer)
                Called after i successfully move to a new location.

Container
        .removeThing(thing)
                remove thing from internal collection(s)
        .canAccept(thing)

        .addThing(thing)
                add thing to default internal collection
        .onAccept(thing)
