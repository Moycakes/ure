all standard UI info requests are made through URECommander which asks a UREInterfacer to draw the widget and get the input
UREInterfacer is an interface implemented by URERenderer
camera param can be set null to get back a JPanel which you have to display yourself -- if camera is passed the element appears in its pane
any overall style info about UI (box outlining, default colors, zoom/wipe/scroll anims) should be set on the Interfacer


.UIpopUpNotice(camera, callback, abortable, "text!")

.UIrequestString(camera, callback, abortable, "text!")

.UIgetDirection(camera, callback, abortable, "prompt", x, y, boolean acceptNull)
        ask for a cardinal direction from screen x,y (if acceptNull, can take no-direction)

.UIpickThing(camera, callback, abortable, list-of-things, maxX, maxY)
